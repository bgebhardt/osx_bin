# Obsidian Set up info and Customizations

This folder contains customizations and a list of the plugins I use.

- snippets - CSS snippets
    - install "shorter-links-enhanced.css" into the snippets folder. It shortens urls unless you mouse over them. This fixes one of my biggest annoyances working in live editor mode in Obsidian.
- themes - themes I use and customizations I've made.
- plugins - list of plugins I currently use including all manifest information.
    - get-plugin-list.sh - script to get information about all installed plugins in a plugins directory
