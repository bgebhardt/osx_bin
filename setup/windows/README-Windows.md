# Windows Setup Info

# Package Managers

**Chocolately** is still a great package manager. [Chocolatey Software | Chocolatey - The package manager for Windows](https://chocolatey.org/)

choco.ps1 is my powershell script of installs no Windows

**Winget** is the built in Windows package manager and is also good.

[winstall](https://winstall.app/) is a great repository of packages you can install by Winget.

# Autokey 

[autokey/autokey: AutoKey, a desktop automation utility for Linux and X11.](https://github.com/autokey/autokey)
I use it to script different key combinations similar to Karabiner on the mac.
