# Brew Services

Run `brew services` to install the brew services which can register services with launchctl

* [Starting and Stopping Background Services with Homebrew](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/starting-and-stopping-background-services-with-homebrew)

## Modify and start service sleepwatcher

I use this to mute and unmute audio when the computer goes to sleep.

For some reason the service doesn't work as a service. Still troubleshooting.

In the short term run this at the command line

sleepwatcher -V -s ~/.sleep -w ~/.wakeup

Scripts are .sleep and .wakeup

`brew services start sleepwatcher`

Currently I manually create .sleep and .wakeup in the home directory.

‚ö° cat .sleep
# simple script to mute sound
osascript -e "set volume with output muted"

‚ö° cat .wakeup
# simple script to unmute sound
osascript -e "set volume without output muted"
