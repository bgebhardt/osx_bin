# Things to remember when backing up your mac

This is a list of settings and things to remember when backing up my mac. I tend to rebuild my environments from scratch vs. restoring from a Time Machine backup. Too make that as easy as possible.

# Main Backup

1. Use [SuperDuper!](https://shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html) to backup user files (all files and  full drive backups often don't always work especially with work controlled machines) to a disk image. Other backup options or resources

2. Confirm SuperDuper! Disk image mounts and has the files on it. Note that CloudStorage won't come over and that many files are invisibles (dot files).

2. Copy over Applications (Superduper doesn't always get them.)
3. Take screen shots of the following
    1. Menubar to get a list of bartender items and order
    2. bartender custom settings
    3. Login items
4. Use session buddy to capture currently open browser windows. See [Session Buddy â€“ Manage Browser Tabs and Bookmarks with Ease](https://sessionbuddy.com/)

# Per App checklists

## Raycast

*Export settings*
Use the "Export Preferences & Data" command to export preferences, aliases, hotkeys, favourites, snippets, quicklinks, floating notes and other data to a "rayconfig" file. Later you can import this configuration file, using the "Import Preferences & Data" command, on the same mac or start just where you left off on a new mac.
